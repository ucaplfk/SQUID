\begin{abstract}
The process of fabricating a direct current (dc) superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) on a pre-patterned silicone ($Si$) wafer with a niobium ($Nb$) film is described. The area of the loop is $9 \times {10^{ - 12}}$ m. The length of the left and right parallel Dayem junctions are approximately 80 nm and 50 nm, respectively. The width of junctions are approximately 70 nm and 50 nm for the left and right junctions, respectively. The critical temperature $T_C$$ = ($8.89 $\pm$ 0.01) of $Nb$ is measured during cryostat cooling of the sample in liquid helium ($He$). The current-voltage (I-V) characteristic plot for the SQUID exhibits hysteric features with the recorded critical current of $I_C$=(5.31 $\pm$0.05) $\mu$A in a magnetic field $B\approx$=0. Investigating the oscillations of the $I_C$ as a function of $B$ requires further measurements to determine the reproducibility an apparent oscillation with a period of 2 mT when $B$ is increased from 0 to 5 mT.
